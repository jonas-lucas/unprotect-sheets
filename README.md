# Unprotect Sheets

This repository provides simple scripts to **remove sheet protection tag** from `.xlsx` (Excel) files. Useful for editing protected sheets or automating access to locked content.

## How to Use

Just run the command bellow:

```bash
python unprotect_sheet.py -i <xlsx_file>
```

A new file will be generated in the format `Unprotect_<xlsx_file>`, adding "Unprotect" at the beginning of the original file name.
